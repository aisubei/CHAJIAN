# Changelog

## 0.3.3 — local-model status fix (npm release, pending)

### Fixes

- **本地模型状态误报修复**：`getLocalModelStatus` 只查询进程内存的下载/加载记录，模型在磁盘上（例如迁移或重启后从未惰性加载）会误报「未就绪」；现在内存无记录时回退**磁盘探测**（权重文件在盘即视为就绪，加载仍惰性）。迁移到新缓存目录后状态查询自动跟随新位置（无需重启）。

## 0.3.2 — Cherry Studio deep-alignment (npm release, pending)

### Retrieval & storage

- **Token-budget chunking** (Cherry's splitter semantics): `chunkSize` /
  `chunkOverlap` are now token budgets converted per document via the
  measured chars-per-token ratio (CJK ~1.5, latin ~4); long blocks cut at
  Cherry's break-point model (heading 100 → code edge 80 → rule 60 →
  paragraph 20 → sentence 8 → list 5 → newline 1, distance-decayed inside
  the 22% window). Defaults raised to 1024/200 (Cherry's).
- **FTS VACUUM fix**: `chunk_fts` keys on a stable `fts_rowid` surrogate
  (trigger-assigned) instead of the implicit rowid, which VACUUM renumbers —
  large deletes no longer silently desync lexical retrieval (Cherry's
  #16132-class fix); existing stores migrate in place.
- **Rerank semantics** (Cherry's mergeRerankResults): only candidates the
  rerank model returned survive the step (top_n = final topK), so relevance
  scores never mix with raw BM25/cosine scores; 401/403/404 log at error.
- **similarityThreshold applies to pure-vector mode** too (Cherry's
  scoreKind semantics).
- **BM25 polish**: short-term LIKE filters relax when they eliminate every
  candidate; the pure-LIKE fallback ANDs one filter per token and orders by
  text length; MAX_MATCH_TERMS=64 caps long CJK queries; zero-norm vectors
  never outrank real hits.
- **Embedding batch retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s→30s)
  before an import degrades to lexical-only (Cherry's job retry contract).

### Lifecycle & reliability

- **Delete × in-flight race fixed**: deleting a document/base invalidates
  its indexing tasks and every finishing write re-checks the row/base still
  exist — a queued or running import can no longer resurrect a deleted row
  or write chunks under a deleted base (Cherry's deleting-guard).
- **Cancel chain**: an AbortController per ingest task aborts in-flight
  embedding HTTP requests and MinerU batches when the document/base is
  deleted; MinerU timeout raised to 30 minutes.
- **Batch conflict detection** (Cherry's addItems detect): the new
  `addFiles` API reports every collision (existing + batch-internal) in one
  authoritative round without adding; clean detects add the whole batch
  atomically.
- **resumeInterruptedOnStartup config**: off marks interrupted imports
  failed instead of auto re-embedding (Cherry: a deliberate quit must not
  re-spend the embedding API).
- **Directory imports persist raw copies** of every supported file under
  tree-relative paths, so a base stays rebuildable if the source disk
  changes (Cherry's prepare-root copy).
- **Error codes**: failed documents carry `errorCode`
  (interrupted / dimension_mismatch / parse_failed / embedding_provider)
  with UI-localized copy and rebuild guidance (Cherry's code→i18n posture).
- **Progress linger**: a finished job's final percentage stays visible for
  ~60s; enable-in-place (BM25→model) refuses while documents are indexing
  or a document has no rebuildable source.

### Parsing & deep-read

- **HTML→Markdown via turndown** (headings/lists/links/code/tables survive
  for the heading-aware chunker; nav/footer/aside/form chrome stripped),
  used by URL import/refresh, .html/.htm files and EPUB pages.
- **Deep-read guards** (Cherry's KnowledgeConceptService): readDocumentText
  caps one slice at 20k chars; grepDocument scans one 2000-char line at a
  time (catastrophic-backtracking patterns can no longer freeze the host)
  and reports a full-document totalMatches.

### UI

- **Local embedding model status**: live 800ms header label + empty-state
  progress ring/guidance with a go-to-settings button.
- **Dimension probe**: saving a changed embedding model (or rebuilding via
  the restore dialog) probes the vector width first; the restore dialog now
  offers an optional model switch with a pre-commit probe.
- **Text (note) add entry**: title + content dialog using the existing host
  `addTextDocument`.
- **Conflict dialog**: lists the colliding file names; resolution buttons
  show loading and the dialog cannot close mid-resolution.
- **File picker**: over 20 files rejects the whole batch (was silent
  truncation); drag-drop filters unsupported extensions and caps the batch.
- **Failed rows** show localized reason labels with a focusable, aria-
  labelled badge; pending rows show 等待中; end-of-list marker after 100
  rows.

## 0.3.1 — Full-project audit fixes + AGPL-3.0 relicensing (npm release, 2026-08-20)

### License

- Project relicensed **MIT → AGPL-3.0**: PDF page rendering depends on
  mupdf (AGPL-3.0), whose copyleft applies to distributions containing it;
  AGPL-3.0 keeps the whole project legally self-consistent (and matches the
  license of its design inspiration, Cherry Studio). LICENSE, package.json
  and both READMEs updated.

### Bug fixes (full-project audit round 3, 23 fixes)

- True cosine (L2-normalized, NaN-safe) in the vector lane and semantic
  chunk merging — non-unit vectors no longer collapse all top scores to 1.0;
  `chunkStats` model counts scoped to the requested bases; empty queries no
  longer return the whole corpus; >500 docId filters throw instead of
  silently truncating; chunk deletes scoped by base id; code fences keep
  their opener length (4+ backticks close correctly); NaN chunk parameters
  guarded.
- XLSX parsing honors cell `t=` types (numbers/dates no longer misread as
  shared-string indices) and joins rich-text shared strings per `<si>`;
  GBK/GB18030 text decode fallback; lone surrogates rejected.
- OCR: per-image (32MP) and per-PDF (512MB) raster caps (forged dimension
  headers can no longer OOM the process); per-page fault isolation; CJK
  lines no longer glued across newlines; hung-worker watchdog respawns
  after consecutive timeouts; tesseract fallback un-poisons itself; page
  destroy in finally.
- UI: per-file failure isolation for file/directory imports; 60s API
  timeout; Escape no longer closes the panel under an open dialog; stale
  base/document/search responses guarded; Ollama installed list loads on
  mount and base-URL change; pull busy flag reset on success; local-model
  cancel waits for the worker's abort ack (no corrupt half-downloads);
  model-cache migration skips dot-entries and never copies a target into
  itself (case-normalized on win32).

## 0.3.0 — Semantic chunking, visual captioning, Ollama & local-model management (npm release, 2026-08-19)

### Retrieval quality

- **Citations**: `knowledge_search` returns a `citations` array (Markdown
  quote + source line per hit) for the model to quote verbatim; the recall
  panel's copy button copies the full citation instead of bare text.
- **Semantic chunking** (`semanticChunk` + `semanticChunkThreshold`):
  paragraph-level segments are embedded and adjacent similar ones merged
  (length-weighted mean vector — no extra embedding pass), per-base
  overridable.
- **Local reranking**: `rerankModel: local:Xenova/bge-reranker-base` runs a
  cross-encoder in the model worker (offline); Settings → Local Models gains
  the BGE Reranker Base card and the suggestion list offers the local option.
- **Code-fence chunk protection**: fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~) never
  split at internal blank lines or heading-like lines.
- **Token-budget chunk refinement** (`chunkTokenLimit`): oversized chunks
  split at preferred boundaries (blank line → 。/！/？ → ， → space).
- **Multi-query retrieval** (`extraQueries`): each phrasing searches
  independently and hits merge by chunk id keeping the best score.
- **Vector lane in-memory cache**: decoded embeddings stay resident per base
  (Float32Array, exact per-doc/per-base invalidation) — repeated searches no
  longer re-fetch/re-decode the BLOBs.
- **RAG-style evaluation** (`scripts/eval-rag.mjs`): Hit@k + sentence-level
  Context Recall (RAGAS-style approximation, no LLM) + MRR against golden
  answers.

### Import & document processing

- **Image/table captioning** (`imageCaptionProvider: openai|ollama`): embedded
  PDF figures (size-filtered, ≤20 per document) are described by a vision
  model and appended to the text — charts become searchable. OpenAI-compatible
  vision API or a local Ollama VLM.
- **Same-name conflict strategies** (`conflictStrategy`, default rename):
  rename (auto `_1` suffix) / replace / keep; per-request `conflict: detect`
  raises a conflict error (HTTP 409).
- **Scheduled URL auto-refresh** (`urlRefreshHours`): stale URL documents are
  re-fetched and re-indexed on an hourly sweep.
- **Parse hardening**: per-glyph math text layers are reassembled from glyph
  coordinates; corrupt-encoding layers fall back to render+OCR; SQLite
  `busy_timeout` fixes "database is locked".

### Local models & Ollama

- **Configurable model cache directory** with native folder picker
  (`ctx.workspaces.pickDirectory`), open-in-file-manager, and **migration**:
  existing models move to the new location (rename, copy+delete across
  drives; worker released first for Windows file locks) and the config
  switches over — no re-downloads, no blind C-drive growth.
- **Ollama model management**: pull with streamed progress + cancel, delete
  (two-step confirm), installed-model chips, embedding/vision recommendations,
  and clear install guidance (ollama.com/download).
- **Download reliability**: worker progress messages throttled (250ms) so a
  585MB download cannot starve the host's HTTP/UI work; Ollama pull streams
  through an AbortController; a leaked rejection in the pull cleanup chain
  (unhandledRejection killing the whole DSH process) is fixed and every void
  promise chain audited.

### Housekeeping

- Emoji replaced with lucide icons (ISC, paths from lucide-static) — Cherry
  Studio's icon library, no new dependency.
- Stale `docs/compare-with-cherry.md` removed from the repo and the npm
  tarball.

### Bug fixes (pre-open-source audit, 14 issues)

- Per-base config overrides for `semanticChunk`, `chunkTokenLimit`,
  `conflictStrategy`, MinerU and image-captioning settings were silently
  stripped by the durable schema on save — the override vanished after a
  refresh. The base-config schema now mirrors `BaseConfig` exactly.
- "Move to 未分组" never persisted: the client sent `group: undefined`,
  which JSON serialization drops; it now sends `''` and the server also
  tolerates `null` from other clients (was a `null.trim()` 500).
- `knowledge_delete_document` / `knowledge_reindex_document` ignored their
  `baseId` argument and never checked the enabled invocation scope; they now
  validate the document's owning base and scope like every other tool.
- Renaming a base into a brand-new group left an orphan group that owned
  bases but was absent from the sidebar list; the group is now registered.
- Reindexing a whole base while an import was running aborted the entire
  sweep on the first in-flight document; busy rows are now skipped
  (Cherry's `REINDEX_ALLOWED_STATUSES` semantics).
- Eval scripts printed `NaN%` on an empty eval set; they now exit with a
  clear message.

## 0.2.2 — Cherry-parity import pipeline + worker-thread local models (npm release)

### Whole-library PDF quality audit + parse decision tree (later addition)

A full audit of every imported document (223 docs) found three distinct PDF
failure modes and one SQLite concurrency bug; the parse pipeline now handles
each:

- **Fragmented text layers are no longer imported blindly.** pdf-parse's
  bundled old pdf.js fragments per-glyph-laid-out math PDFs into one "line"
  per glyph (avg line ≈ 1–5 chars) and corrupt-encoding layers yield junk
  sequences. The new decision tree measures the extracted text's line health:
  healthy (avg ≥ 5) → keep; per-glyph math → reassemble true lines from
  glyph coordinates via the new pdfjs (`getTextContent` items carry their
  transform matrix; y-clustering + x-sort, the same reassembly Cherry applies
  to OCR boxes); still junk (avg < 12 after reassembly) → render + OCR;
  only then anydoc, then the fragmented original as the last resort.
- **Corrupt-encoding text layers now OCR instead of indexing garbage** (e.g.
  a journal PDF whose glyph mapping read `L PE T R t)1 U M R…` now imports
  the rendered page's OCR text: "炼油技术与工程…摘要：提出了--种混合模拟退火
  算法…").
- **SQLite `database is locked` on concurrent writes fixed**: the chunk store
  never set `busy_timeout` (SQLite default 0), so a write that met another
  connection's lock failed instantly instead of waiting. Now `PRAGMA
  busy_timeout = 5000` (two documents in the library had failed embeddings
  from this).
- **Verified against the real library**: 马尔科夫链模型.pdf (vector-drawn,
  281 glyph-fragment chunks → renders cleanly), 基于逻辑模拟退火法的炼油厂…
  (corrupt text layer, 554 × 7-char chunks → OCRs to readable paragraphs),
  plus the earlier JBIG2 scan fix. Documents already imported with bad text
  must be re-imported to benefit (the stored text is what it was).

### Scanned/vector PDF OCR — full-page rendering (later addition to this release)

- **PDFs whose pages are vector-drawn instead of embedded rasters now OCR
  correctly.** Many textbook PDFs (e.g. mathematical lecture notes) draw the
  body with subsetted fonts and embed only decorative fragments (rule lines,
  isolated formula glyphs); pdf-parse/anydoc extract nothing and the old
  embedded-raster extraction OCR'd those fragments into single-character
  noise (one "chunk" per glyph, hundreds of micro-chunks per document).
- **Pages are now rendered with mupdf (Artifex' WASM build) at ~216dpi**
  (Cherry's pdfPageOcr posture) and the full-page raster is OCR'd, so
  vector-only pages produce coherent line text. pdfjs's CanvasGraphics
  rendering onto @napi-rs/canvas crashes the process (native incompatibility),
  hence mupdf: pure WASM, no native code, no canvas globals. pdfjs remains
  only for the embedded-raster extraction fallback (no renderer available).
- **Verified against a real 40-page Markov-chain lecture PDF**: 8 pages OCR
  in ~5s with clean paragraphs ("马尔可夫链模型" / "描述一类重要的系统
  （过程）的模型 …"), where the old path produced 281 single-character
  chunks from the first ~5 pages and nothing after.

### Bug-fix round (later additions to this release)

- **Local-model worker could be killed mid-download**: the 60s idle-release
  timer fired while a model download/load was still running (progress
  messages never reset it), terminating the worker and failing the request —
  a 585MB first download is guaranteed to hit this. Progress reports now
  keep the timer alive, and the timer never fires while a request is
  in-flight.
- **A failed local-model load was cached forever**: `getExtractor` kept the
  rejected promise, so every later request failed until the model was
  removed; failures are now dropped from the cache and retried.
- **Symbol-only search queries crashed retrieval**: `MATCH ''` is an FTS5
  syntax error, so searching `!!!` returned HTTP 500; such queries now route
  to the safe LIKE scan. Regression-tested in a new `chunkdb.spec.ts`.
- **Cancel-then-redownload of a local model was blocked**: the cancellation
  marker never expired, so re-downloading the same model always failed;
  markers now auto-expire.
- **Model deletion could fail on Windows file locks**: the worker's release
  ack is now awaited (with a grace timeout) before the cache directory is
  removed.
- **`normalizeRgba` could misclassify single-channel grayscale as 1-bit**:
  branch order hardened (pdfjs's decoded layout varies with raster size —
  RGBA for small images, RGB for larger grayscale, bit-packed for 1-bit).
- **Tests never exercised the real pdfjs decode path**: the synthetic scanned
  PDFs were byte-corrupt (latin1→UTF-8 inflation), so OCR tests only hit the
  gate; the builder now concatenates raw bytes and new tests decode real
  rasters through pdfjs (8-bit grayscale and 1-bit both verified).
- **Oversized uploads failed with an opaque server error**: files above
  ~24MB (the 32MB JSON body cap after base64) are now pre-checked client-side
  with a clear message in both the file picker and directory import paths.

### Installability hardening + OCR mirror (later additions to this release)

- **Zero-basis install fixes**: the tarball no longer declares peer
  dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/*`, react, zod are all injected by the DSH
  host as externals; declaring them made pnpm's auto-install-peers resolve
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` → `@deepseek-ai/dsh-type-meta`, which does not
  exist on the public registry and broke fresh installs). The Windows
  `@napi-rs/canvas-win32-x64-msvc` platform package moved to
  `optionalDependencies` so Linux/macOS installs no longer hit platform
  rejection. Verified end-to-end: a clean profile-style pnpm install
  (`nodeLinker: hoisted`, `autoInstallPeers: false`) with the documented
  `allowBuilds` exits 0 and the bundle registers.
- **OCR model mirror configurable**: the PaddleOCR download now honors the
  `hfEndpoint` setting (default hf-mirror.com), so users outside China can
  point it at `https://huggingface.co` like the embedding model.

### OCR for scanned PDFs (later additions to this release)

- **Local OCR engine — PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv5 mobile, full Chinese dictionary)**
  with Tesseract.js as fallback, both inside a dedicated worker thread.
  Scanned PDFs (no text layer) are recognized automatically once the models
  are downloaded (~25MB, Settings → Local Models). PP-OCRv6's ONNX repos
  ship a symbol-only dictionary (no CJK), so v5 mobile is the practical
  Chinese-capable choice. Image preprocessing (grayscale → normalize →
  sharpen, 2x upscale) mirrors Cherry's chain; CJK inter-glyph spaces are
  collapsed; JBIG2/CCITT 1-bit bitmaps are unpacked correctly (scanner
  scans).
- **MinerU remote document processor** (Cherry's `mineru` file processor):
  optional per-base/global setting routes PDFs through the MinerU API
  (batch task → signed upload → poll → result zip → Markdown) for the best
  scanned/complex-layout quality; any API failure falls back to the local
  pipeline (parsers → OCR), so a misconfigured remote never blocks imports.
- **Embedding-model change routes** (Cherry's `resolveEmbeddingModelChangeRoute`):
  an empty base saves directly; a BM25-only base gaining a model backfills
  vectors in place; switching an already-configured model is refused with
  rebuild guidance (restore carries the new model config).
- PDFs preview in an embedded viewer (native browser viewer via blob URL);
  drag & drop upload; directory imports filter unsupported formats/hidden
  entries; embedding vector-width guard; reindex skips in-flight rows;
  download failures surface visibly.

### (Original 0.2.2 entry below)

The import path is rebuilt around Cherry Studio's architecture (verified
against its source), and local-model inference moves off the main process.

- **Uncapped directory imports**: the folder picker no longer truncates to
  the 20-item interactive-file limit (Cherry imports a directory as one
  source with no cap); the 20 limit now applies to file/note picks only,
  with a "too many files" hint. The import failure dialog is gone — failed
  imports keep their row, marked red with the reason (Cherry's failed items),
  reindexable from the raw copy.
- **Cherry-style parallel import**: `addFileDocument` creates the row and
  returns immediately; parse+ingest runs on a per-base worker pool
  (concurrency 5, Cherry's `defaultConcurrency`), rows flip
  parsing → embedding x% → completed/failed via the existing status poll.
  Dedup check + first persist run under a per-base write lock so concurrent
  identical imports cannot both pass.
- **Local embedding in a dedicated worker thread** (Cherry's "in its own
  worker" `InferenceServiceBase`): transformers.js and its ~600MB model run
  off the main process — a large import batch can no longer freeze the host
  (previously the in-process model plus 5 concurrent parses exceeded the
  main heap and froze the whole web instance). Serialized inference in the
  worker, request/response ids with timeout, 60s idle release of the loaded
  model, crash → fail in-flight + respawn, `unref()` so the worker never
  blocks shutdown; proxy + HF mirror honoured inside the worker.
- **Download failures are visible**: a background model download/load
  failure lands in the status map (`error` + reason) instead of being
  swallowed, so the Local Models panel shows why a download did not start.
- **Cherry-detail pass**: drag & drop upload onto the document list (the
  hint existed, the handlers did not); directory imports filter unsupported
  formats and hidden entries up front (Cherry's directory scan) with a
  "skipped N" toast; server-side extension whitelist rejects binaries
  before a row is created; embedding vector-width guard (Cherry's
  `assertEmbeddingVectors`) prevents a switched model from corrupting cosine
  search; reindex skips in-flight rows (Cherry's `REINDEX_ALLOWED_STATUSES`)
  with visible counts; `.mdx` joins the supported formats.
- Retrieval behavior and eval baselines are unchanged.

## 0.2.12 — Remove real eval sets (privacy)

The four real evaluation sets (`eval-questions.json`, `eval-rephrase.json`,
`eval-extra.json`, `eval-base22.json`) were built from private study
materials, so they are removed from the repo and its history. The runner
(`scripts/eval-retrieval.mjs`) and the example template
(`scripts/eval-questions.example.json`) remain, so anyone can build their own
sets. Run `node scripts/eval-retrieval.mjs --file your-set.json --base <id>`.

## 0.2.11 — Security hardening (SSRF, path traversal, zip bombs)

Audit-driven hardening of the import paths:

- **SSRF guard on URL import**: `fetchHtml` now refuses non-http(s) protocols
  and loopback / link-local / RFC1918 private hosts (`127.0.0.0/8`,
  `10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`, `169.254.x`, `0.x`, `localhost`,
  `[::1]`, `metadata.google.internal`, …) before any request is sent. The
  `knowledge_import_url` tool and the URL refresh path share the guard.
- **Redirect re-validation**: fetch no longer follows redirects implicitly —
  `httpFetch` accepts a `redirect: 'manual'` policy and `fetchHtml` walks up
  to 5 hops itself, validating every hop's protocol and host. A public page
  can no longer 302 to an internal address to bypass the check.
- **Path-traversal depth**: `RawFileStorage.deleteBase` now validates its
  `baseId` through the same boundary as every other raw path (a tampered
  domain record could previously have driven `rm -rf` outside the raw root).
- **Zip-bomb guard**: office archives (docx/pptx/xlsx/epub) whose declared
  uncompressed size exceeds 256 MB are rejected before any entry is inflated.
- **Route segment decoding**: `/knowledge/*` path segments are
  `decodeURIComponent`-decoded so encoded ids resolve like the JSON API.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.10 — Extended retrieval eval sets

Two new real eval sets join the original 24 questions:

- **`scripts/eval-extra.json`** (16 questions, base 11): covers documents the
  original set did not touch (偏最小二乘回归 / 随机模拟与系统仿真 /
  微分方程建模), plus harder variants of covered topics (Little 定律, 生灭过程,
  CR 一致性检验, 0-1 背包, Kruskal, 允许缺货, Leslie 矩阵, EDD 规则, …).
  Baseline: hybrid Hit@5 0.938 vs lexical 0.778 — the vector lane bridges
  another +0.16 over the extra questions. Two stub documents with 0 chunks
  (计算机仿真 / 数学建模算法, empty imports) are noted in the set and not
  tested; the Leslie question is a known semantic gap (the term never appears
  in the 差分方程 document).
- **`scripts/eval-base22.json`** (6 questions, base 22): retrieval of the
  writing-guide documents (math-model-writing) and data corpora (oil.csv /
  holidays_events.csv / ensemble_log.txt). The three writing questions hit
  1.0 in every mode; the three data questions fail in every mode — a real
  property of tabular/CSV retrieval (numeric cells carry no semantic text),
  kept as a documented known gap.

No runtime behavior changed.

## 0.2.9 — Space reclamation after large deletes (Cherry's reclaimSpace)

Deleting documents no longer leaves the freed pages stranded in the chunk
store file. `ChunkDatabase.reclaimSpace` mirrors Cherry's `reclaimSpace` +
driver thresholds:

- **WAL checkpoint first** (cheap; folds the delete's committed frees into
  the main file so `freelist_count` reflects them).
- **Threshold-gated VACUUM**: only when the freelist is ≥20% of the file AND
  ≥8 MB — a small delete never pays for a whole-file rewrite whose pages a
  later index would reuse anyway.
- **FTS 'optimize' before the VACUUM**: the external-content trigram index
  only TOMBSTONES its rows on delete; the dead segment blobs linger in the
  shadow table, which VACUUM cannot reclaim on its own.
- **Reclaim after delete**: `deleteBase`, `deleteDocument`, and
  `deleteDocuments` call it synchronously; the thresholds keep the common
  case a no-op. Memory-backed stores skip it.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.8 — Multi-model local embedding registry

The Settings → Local Models page now offers five download-ready in-process
models instead of one, and each model gets the pooling strategy its family
requires — Cherry Studio's `pooling.ts` posture, previously hardcoded to
Qwen3's last-token pooling.

- **Registry**: `onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX` (1024-dim, zh,
  last-token), `Xenova/bge-small-zh-v1.5` (512-dim, zh, CLS),
  `Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim, en, CLS), `Xenova/gte-small` (384-dim,
  multilingual, mean), `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` (384-dim, multilingual,
  mean). Every entry is a real, downloadable transformers.js ONNX repo.
- **Per-family pooling** (`poolingFor`): Qwen3 → last-token, BGE/BCE → CLS,
  GTE/E5/unknown → mean — a BGE model previously produced wrong vectors under
  the hardcoded last-token pooling.
- **Suggestions synced**: the settings combobox's local list mirrors the
  registry exactly, so every suggestion is actually downloadable.
- The default model and its pooling are unchanged, so existing embeddings and
  eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.7 — Metadata-filtered search

Search can now be narrowed to a document subset by metadata — a capability
neither Cherry Studio's search nor the reference implementation offers
(Cherry's `metadata` is output-only; its search is scoped by base alone).

- **`filter` on search requests**: `docIds`, `titleIncludes` (case-insensitive
  substring), `sourceTypes` (file / text / url / directory), and
  `updatedAfter` / `updatedBefore` (epoch ms) — all optional, ANDed.
- **Resolved once into a doc-id allow-list** shared by both retrieval paths:
  the SQL lanes push `doc_id IN (...)` into the FTS5 / vector queries (bounded
  to SQLite's parameter limit), and the in-memory fallback filters candidates.
  A filter that matches nothing returns zero hits.
- **Exposed** in the `knowledge_search` tool parameters (`docIds`,
  `titleIncludes`, `sourceTypes`, `updatedAfter`, `updatedBefore`), the HTTP
  `/search` route, and the browser panel types.
- Retrieval ranking is untouched; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.6 — Directory subtree operations (Cherry's outermost-root folding)

Batch operations now understand the directory tree. `deleteDocuments` and
`reindexDocuments` fold their selection to the outermost roots first —
Cherry's `getOutermostSelectedItemIds` semantics — so a directory plus one of
its descendants in the same batch is handled once, and each selected
directory operates on its whole subtree recursively.

- **Subtree delete**: `deleteDocuments` removes a selected directory and
  everything below it (chunks + raw files + rows), instead of leaving orphaned
  descendants behind.
- **Subtree reindex**: `reindexDocument` on a directory container recursively
  reindexes its descendants; `reindexDocuments` and `reindexBase` fold the
  selection so no document is reindexed twice (a directory's children are
  covered by the directory itself).
- **New tool `knowledge_reindex_document`**: re-index one document or a whole
  directory subtree (Cherry's `refreshConcepts` counterpart) — re-reads the
  raw source, re-chunks, and re-embeds only what changed.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.5 — URL snapshots with refresh

URL documents now keep a persisted snapshot of the fetched text (Cherry's
snapshot model): the base owns a stable copy, reindex re-reads it, and
refresh re-fetches the page and updates the snapshot + index in place.

- **Snapshot on import**: `addUrlDocument` persists the fetched text as
  `<baseId>/<docId>.md` in the raw store (`rawFilePath`), so a URL document is
  rebuildable from its snapshot and crash recovery covers the fetch/parse
  window like any file import.
- **Refresh**: `refreshUrlDocument` re-fetches the page; when the text (or
  title) changed it overwrites the snapshot and re-indexes — hash reuse
  re-embeds only the chunks that changed. An unchanged page or a failed fetch
  leaves the current snapshot and index untouched; refresh never degrades.
- **Surface**: `POST /knowledge/documents/:id/refresh`, the
  `knowledge_refresh_url` tool (returns `changed: false` for no-op), and a
  "刷新快照" action on URL document rows in the panel.
- **Bug fix**: the in-memory store's `putChunks` now mirrors the SQLite
  replace semantics (drop the document's old rows first) — a reindex in a
  memory-backed profile no longer leaves stale chunks searchable.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.4 — Raw source storage (Cherry's "import means copy")

Uploaded file documents now keep their original bytes — Cherry's `raw/`
material store, adapted to the plugin layout: `<chunkStoreDir>/knowledge-raw/
<baseId>/<docId><ext>`, with the base-relative path recorded on the document
(`rawFilePath`).

- **Import means copy**: the base owns a stable copy of every uploaded file;
  deleting the document removes it, `deleteBase` sweeps the whole base's
  directory, and restore copies the bytes across so a restored base stays
  rebuildable from source.
- **Reindex from source**: `reindexDocument` re-reads and re-parses the raw
  bytes first (a parser upgrade now actually improves extraction on reindex),
  falling back to the stored text and then to reconstructed chunks when the
  file is gone — a reindex never wipes vectors for an unrebuildable source.
  This is Cherry's `canKnowledgeItemRebuildSource` posture, made simpler by
  the plugin's atomic overwrite writes (no delete-then-rebuild window).
- **Crash recovery from the file**: a placeholder that only holds a raw file
  (crash before/during parse) is now resumed from source instead of dropped —
  the same recoverability Cherry gets from its `raw/` copy.
- **Download route**: `GET /knowledge/documents/:id/raw` streams the original
  bytes (attachment, original mime type).
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.3 — Sibling-chunk context on search hits

Each search hit now carries its surrounding chunks (`siblingContext`,
±`siblingChunks` in the same document, in reading order, heading-prefixed) —
the full paragraph a RAG answer needs, instead of a bare chunk that often
cuts a sentence mid-way. Cherry Studio returns only the single chunk body,
so this is an enhancement over the reference implementation.

- **New setting `siblingChunks`** (0–3, default 1, 0 = off) in Settings and
  per-base config: how many neighbouring chunks (±) to attach to each hit.
- **One bounded SQL query** per hit (`listChunksByIndexRange`) — no full
  document scan, works on the SQLite-backed store and the in-memory fallback.
- **Exposed everywhere the hit is**: `SearchResult.hits[].siblingContext` in
  the HTTP API, the `knowledge_search` tool schema, its text render (context
  before the hit, `>>>` marker), and the browser panel types.
- Retrieval ranking is untouched; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.2 — Crash-resumable imports (internal iteration, not published to npm)

A crash mid-embedding no longer loses the document. `ingestDocument` now
persists the document (with its source text, marked `incomplete`) BEFORE
embedding starts, and `buildChunks` lands every finished embedding batch into
the chunk store as it completes (`putChunkBatch`, an incremental upsert that
does not clear the document's other rows). On the next start, startup recovery
reports interrupted documents instead of dropping them, and the service
automatically resumes each one: hash reuse (0.2.1) re-embeds only the batches
that never landed, so a multi-hour PDF import interrupted at 60% resumes from
60% — no re-upload, no full re-embed.

- **Incremental batch persistence**: `ChunkDatabase.putChunkBatch` (upsert by
  chunk id, rowid-stable `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` so the FTS trigger chain stays
  consistent) — the crash-recovery write path used by both import and reindex.
- **Interrupted-document recovery**: `recoverInterruptedImports` now returns
  `{ removed, resume }` — `removed` stays the pure placeholders with no
  recoverable text (parse crashed before the source was persisted); `resume`
  lists documents holding rawText that were `incomplete` when the process
  died. The service re-indexes them in the background after startup.
- **Resumable reindex**: `reindexDocument` marks the document incomplete while
  it rebuilds, so a crash during reindex is recovered the same way.
- Retrieval behavior is unchanged; eval baselines are identical.

## 0.2.1 — Library-wide embedding reuse (Cherry's decision A4)

Re-embedding unchanged text no longer re-spends the embedding API. Each chunk
row now persists `embedding_text_hash` (sha256 of the exact search text the
embedding model sees), and `buildChunks` asks the store which of the new
chunk hashes already have a vector under the current embedding model before
calling the API — only the missing hashes are embedded.

- **Library-wide reuse**: a reindex, a chunk-size change, or a fresh import of
  text already indexed elsewhere (same base, another base, or the same
  document) reuses the stored vector whenever `(hash, embedding_model)` matches
  — the same dedup Cherry Studio gets from its `embedding` table keyed by
  `embedding_text_hash`. The model is part of the key because one chunk store
  can serve several bases with different models, so a hash alone is not a valid
  reuse key.
- **Automatic migration**: on first start after upgrade, the `embedding_text_hash`
  column is added and backfilled for every stored vector from its `search_text`
  (idempotent; ~3k vectors backfill in well under a second). The hash index is
  created after the column exists, so an older store opens cleanly.
- **No behavior change to retrieval**: reuse only affects which vectors are
  *computed*, not what is stored or searched; eval baselines are unchanged.

## 0.2.0 — SQLite chunk store + SQL retrieval (scale fix)

Chunk data moved out of the durable domain (`json` backend, which atomically
rewrote the whole unit file on every write — deletion and import slowed as
data grew) into a dedicated SQLite file (Node's built-in `node:sqlite`) where
every chunk put/delete is a single statement. This mirrors Cherry Studio's
design: business state (bases, documents, runtime config) stays in the domain,
the chunk index lives in its own engine.

- **Chunk storage**: one row per chunk in `<DSH_HOME>/storages/knowledge-chunks.sqlite` (configurable via `chunkStorePath`); embeddings stored as little-endian float32 BLOBs (Cherry's A1). Delete a document/base = one statement regardless of chunk count.
- **SQL retrieval lanes** (Cherry's FTS5 + brute-force vector posture): the lexical lane runs an external-content **FTS5 trigram** index (BM25 scoring in SQL, with CJK trigram windowing and a LIKE fallback for terms a trigram index cannot see); the vector lane scans the scope's stored BLOBs at query time. Hybrid search fuses both lanes with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. The in-memory JS rank path remains as the fallback for stores without SQL lanes.
- **Bounded reads**: nothing is loaded into memory at open; document lists, stats, and search run bounded SQL queries, so resident memory no longer scales with the corpus.
- **Automatic migration**: on first start after upgrade, chunks still stored in the legacy `knowledge.json` unit are moved into the SQLite store (duplicate rows from an interrupted earlier migration are dropped), and the previous per-document bundle layout is converted to per-chunk rows; the JSON unit then trims itself on the next write.
- **Parse/embedding status**: during import the file row appears immediately with live 解析中 / 嵌入中 NN% status, and folder rows show 导入中 while any descendant is processing.

## 0.1.0 (initial release)

A Cherry Studio-style knowledge base as a standalone, open-source bundle plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH).

### Features

- **Knowledge bases & groups**: create / rename / delete bases, grouped sidebar navigation with collapsible sections, move-to-group, and group create / rename / delete.
- **Documents**: add text, upload files (txt / md / csv / html / json / pdf / docx / pptx / xlsx / epub, multi-file drag-drop), import a URL, or import a whole directory; same-name conflict resolution (keep all / replace); content-hash dedup; per-document ready/not-embedded status and relative update time.
- **Chunking**: heading-aware smart chunking with configurable size / overlap / separator, with the document title + heading path injected as retrieval context.
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama, an in-process local model (transformers.js, default `onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX`), or lexical-only fallback (CJK bigram + latin BM25).
- **Retrieval**: BM25 + vector hybrid with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, MMR diversity, optional rerank (Jina / SiliconFlow / Cohere v2 style APIs), search modes (auto / hybrid / vector / lexical), and a score threshold; recall test with highlighted match snippets, per-hit vector/lexical scores, latency, and replayable history.
- **Local model manager**: a Settings → "Local Models" page with download / cancel / remove / retry and a live progress bar; configurable cache directory (`localModelCacheDir`).
- **Management panel**: a sidebar-foot entry opening a frame-wide Cherry Studio-style page (source list as a table with multi-select bulk reindex/delete, recall test, and per-base rag settings), plus model-id suggestion comboboxes.
- **Model tools**: `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_list_bases`, `knowledge_create_base`, `knowledge_delete_base`, `knowledge_add_document`, `knowledge_list_documents`, `knowledge_delete_document`, `knowledge_import_url`, `knowledge_stats`, `knowledge_get_document`, `knowledge_reindex_base`.

### Persistence

Business state (bases, documents, runtime config) is durable through DSH's
`storageDomain` seam (`json` backend), falling back to in-memory when no
storage backend is available. Chunks live in a dedicated SQLite file
(`<DSH_HOME>/storages/knowledge-chunks.sqlite`).
